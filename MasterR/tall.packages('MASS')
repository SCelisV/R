_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Draws a 2-dimensional “clusplot” (clustering plot) on the current
     graphics device.  The generic function has a default and a
     ‘partition’ method.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     clusplot(x, ...)
     
     ## S3 method for class 'partition'
     clusplot(x, main = NULL, dist = NULL, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: an R object, here, specifically an object of class
          ‘"partition"’, e.g. created by one of the functions ‘pam’,
          ‘clara’, or ‘fanny’.

    main: title for the plot; when ‘NULL’ (by default), a title is
          constructed, using ‘x$call’.

    dist: when ‘x’ does not have a ‘diss’ nor a ‘data’ component, e.g.,
          for ‘pam(dist(*), keep.diss=FALSE)’, ‘dist’ must specify the
          dissimilarity for the clusplot.

     ...: optional arguments passed to methods, notably the
          ‘clusplot.default’ method (except for the ‘diss’ one) may
          also be supplied to this function.  Many graphical parameters
          (see ‘par’) may also be supplied as arguments here.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The ‘clusplot.partition()’ method relies on ‘clusplot.default’.

     If the clustering algorithms ‘pam’, ‘fanny’ and ‘clara’ are
     applied to a data matrix of observations-by-variables then a
     clusplot of the resulting clustering can always be drawn.  When
     the data matrix contains missing values and the clustering is
     performed with ‘pam’ or ‘fanny’, the dissimilarity matrix will be
     given as input to ‘clusplot’.  When the clustering algorithm
     ‘clara’ was applied to a data matrix with NAs then clusplot will
     replace the missing values as described in ‘clusplot.default’,
     because a dissimilarity matrix is not available.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     For the ‘partition’ (and ‘default’) method: An invisible list with
     components ‘Distances’ and ‘Shading’, as for ‘clusplot.default’,
     see there.

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     a 2-dimensional clusplot is created on the current graphics
     device.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘clusplot.default’ for references; ‘partition.object’, ‘pam’,
     ‘pam.object’, ‘clara’, ‘clara.object’, ‘fanny’, ‘fanny.object’,
     ‘par’.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

      ## For more, see ?clusplot.default
     
     ## generate 25 objects, divided into 2 clusters.
     x <- rbind(cbind(rnorm(10,0,0.5), rnorm(10,0,0.5)),
                cbind(rnorm(15,5,0.5), rnorm(15,5,0.5)))
     clusplot(pam(x, 2))
     ## add noise, and try again :
     x4 <- cbind(x, rnorm(25), rnorm(25))
     clusplot(pam(x4, 2))
